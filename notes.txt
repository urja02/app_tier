Have to install cpu only version of  torch, torch-vision, torch-audio from the specified url 
instead of PyPI. 
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

We won't install facenet pytorch as a module but instead have the codebase for that in our repostiory.
